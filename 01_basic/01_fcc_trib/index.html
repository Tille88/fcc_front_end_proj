  <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
  <h2>(The Only Person A Photo on Wiki's HTML Site)</h2>
  
  <p>And here first is said photo:</p>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg">
  
  <p>Now in order to fulfill this suuuper basic exercise, we need to first make sure we have some more text perhaps, so slightly rewritten from wiki:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>He is also known as TimBL for some reason</li>
    <li><em>DA</em> inventor of the World Wide Web!!!</li>
    <li>...that was back in 1989 btw</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>And lastly the link to said <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">wiki</a></p>
  <p>There's another photo in there, TimBL sure has aged...</p>
